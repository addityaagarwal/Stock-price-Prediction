Predicting Price of Apple Stock Exchange using GPR and Random Forest.

A 30/70 test/train split was made to validate the algorithm and then predict data 15 days into the future. 

Daily high price for about 1000 trading days was sourced from Yahoo Finance.

For every input into the algo, 15 days high prices were feeded as X and the next day price as Y.

This helped us input the data for a duration of time as a row and easily build a model for forecasting price.
